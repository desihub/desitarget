desitarget Change Log
=====================

2.2.2 (unreleased)
------------------

* No changes yet.

2.2.1 (2021-11-22)
------------------

* Small modification on skyhealpixs.py [`PR #776`_]:
    * Adjust the per-healpix file name.
    * Set (nside, nest) arguments, defaulting to (64, True).

.. _`PR #776`: https://github.com/desihub/desitarget/pull/776

2.2.0 (2021-11-21)
------------------

* Add ``SCND_TARGET`` for backup targets if nosec is passed [`PR #775`_].
* Add another MWS backup object type BACKUP_GIANT_LOP. The default
  BACKUP_GIANT category is now downsampled with galactic latitude to
  avoid having large densities [`PR #772`_].
* Change backup target priorities to be between 15-30 to be able to place
  new object types in between [`PR #772`_].
* Use Gaia to look up good sky positions for stuck fibers [`PR #771`_].

.. _`PR #771`: https://github.com/desihub/desitarget/pull/771
.. _`PR #772`: https://github.com/desihub/desitarget/pull/772
.. _`PR #775`: https://github.com/desihub/desitarget/pull/775

2.1.0 (2021-11-16)
------------------

* First steps towards MTL for reprocessed tiles [`PR #774`_]. Includes:
    * Finding reprocessed tiles using ``ARCHIVEDATE`` and ``TIMESTAMP``.
    * Adding a ``--reprocess`` option to the run_mtl_loop script.
        * MTL will only reprocess when forced to do so.
    * Keep reprocessing completely separate from "standard" MTL looping.
        * So the approaches can be run independently.
    * Looser error checking because we may be reprocessing piecemeal.
        * i.e. zdone could change from true to false for some tiles.
    * The skeleton of the logic for updating reprocessed targets.
        * In the :func:`mtl.reprocess_ledger()` function.
        * This will need tested and updated in a future PR.

.. _`PR #774`: https://github.com/desihub/desitarget/pull/774

2.0.0 (2021-11-11)
------------------

* Add ``ARCHIVEDATE`` to the mtl done files and data model [`PR #773`_].
    * Also change the type of ``ZDATE`` to int64.
    * These changes will not generally be backward compatible for MTL.
* Fix some typos in variables' names in the targeting cuts [`PR #770`_].
  All of those likely never were triggered in production.
* Find MTL-processed tiles that don't overlap future tiles [`PR #768`_]:
    * Add code to purge such tiles from the MTL done files and ledgers.
    * Also improve reading headers and header values from .ecsv files.
    * Also update GAIA EDR3 files to include RA/Dec errors and REF_EPOCH.
* Update targetmask and cuts for backup program [`PR #766`_]:
    * Matches description in backup program document.
* Also use the ops/tiles-specstatus.ecsv tile file for SV [`PR #765`_].
* Fix a few variable name typos in the target selection code [`PR #770`_].
  All of those likely never were triggered in production.

1.3.0 (2021-09-20)
------------------

* Add secondaries to MTL ledgers without merging [`PR #764`_]:
    * Fix a bug reading ecsv headers with :func:`io.read_ecsv_header()`:
        * Now strictly extracts dictionaries after the meta keyword.
    * Add new targeting bits for ``RR_LYRAE`` and ``MWS_FAINT_*``.
    * Update :func:`secondary.select_secondary()` to ignore primaries:
        * Every target is effectively treated as an ``OVERRIDE`` target.
        * Adds a ``TARGETID`` based on ``main2`` to prevent duplicates.
    * Add a new ``add_secondary_no_merge`` script.
    * Functionality to append to ledgers in :func:`io.write_mtl()`.
    * Similarly, add an append option to ``make_initial_ledger`` script.
* Functionality to override MTL ledger entries [`PR #763`_]. Includes:
    * ``add_to_override_ledgers`` to create or expand override ledgers.
    * ``force_mtl_overrides`` to force overrides into the MTL ledgers.
    * Processing overrides automatically as part of the MTL loop.
    * Override ledgers can be read using MTL utilities in desitarget.io.
* Add a ``TIMESTAMP`` to the Main Survey ToO Ledgers [`PR #761`_].
* Add ``POORDATA`` bit 11 to zwarn_mask for consistency with redrock
  [`PR #757`_].

        * Addresses `issue #749`_.
        * Also part of `PR #753`_ but I needed it to make progress.
    * Change the location of the "ZTILE" (zdone=True/False) file:
        * For sv it was $ZCAT_DIR/tiles.csv
        * For main it will be $MTL_DIR/../ops/tiles-specstatus.ecsv
    * A workaround to process SV3 files that have Main-like fibermaps.

    * Remove special logic for merging ``MWS_FAINT`` with secondaries.

.. _`PR #748`: https://github.com/desihub/desitarget/pull/748

1.1.0 (2021-05-29)
------------------

* Don't allow ``MWS_FAINT`` classes to affect secondaries [`PR #746`_].
* Set up the end-to-end MTL Main Survey loop [`PR #744`_]. Includes:
    * mtl-done-tiles file ``TIMESTAMP`` is later than any ledger entry.
    * Read the zcats from the zqso files instead of making a "backstop".
    * Add ``IS_QSO_QN`` column to the initial ledgers.
        Again, this is not backwards-compatible to version `1.0.0`.
* override_subpriority support duplicate input TARGETID from secondaries
  [`PR #743`_].
* Support reading mtl 1.0.0 format with different columns [`PR #742`_].
* Enable optional subpriority overrides [`PR #740`_, `PR #741`_].
* Allow initial ledgers to use a preordained timestamp [`PR #739`_].
    * ``MWS_FAINT`` targets can be exempted from this timestamp.

        * ``ZS`` and ``ZINFO`` are replaced by ``Z_QN``
	* This is not backwards-compatible to version `1.0.0`
    * Fix `PR #734`_ bug where ``hpxlist`` was used in `write_secondary`.
* Ensure fixed order of input files for reproducible outputs [`PR #738`_].
* Refactor data model and I/O for the QSO zcats [`PR #737`_]. Includes:
    * New directory structures.
    * Allow filenames to be passed instead of TILE/NIGHT combinations.
    * Always run QuasarNP (QN) by default.
    * Update which redrock columns are populated in the output files.
    * Only include output columns for afterburners that are run.
* Add option to use Gaia EDR3 when selecting GFAs [`PR #734`_]. Also:
    * Initialize ``SUBPRIORITY`` with better random seeds.
         * This is crucial when parallelizing across HEALPixels.
    * Document that the ``io.write_`` routines alter ``SUBPRIORITY``.
         * Plus, add a keyword to turn that overwriting behavior off.
    * Add ``leq`` kwarg when reading ledgers with a specific `isodate`.
         * Allows ledger entries to be read BEFORE or ON that date.
         * Supplements the default of reading STRICTLY BEFORE that date.
* Fix bug leading to zero MWS_FAINT targets [`PR #733`_].

1.0.1 (2021-05-14)
------------------

* Add $SKYBRICKS_DIR to module config [`PR #732`_].
    * Also, make more portable by using $DESI_ROOT.

.. _`PR #732`: https://github.com/desihub/desitarget/pull/732

1.0.0 (2021-05-12)
------------------

* Near-final Main Survey MTL logic for repeats [`PR #731`_]. Includes:
    * All MWS targets are observed twice before dropping to DONE.
        * The repeat is at an interstitial, relatively low priority.
        * Except MWS_BHB, which is repeated at relatively high priority.
    * All QSO targets are observed twice before dropping to DONE.
        * The repeat is at an interstitial, relatively low priority.
        * Except z > 1.6 quasars, which receive 4 observations:
            * QSOs at z > 2.1 are repeated at high priority.
            * QSOs at 1.6 < z < 2.1 repeated at relatively low priority.
        * Same logic is applied for secondaries that have flavor QSO.
    * All other primaries are observed once before dropping to DONE.
    * Expand ``TARGET_STATE`` to include full bit-names for all targets.
        * Previously, BGS, MWS, secondary only had "BGS", "MWS", "SCND".
    * Add some extra informational redshift columns in the ledgers:
        * ``ZS`` intended to hold RR for redrock, QN for QuasarNET, etc.
        * ``ZINFO`` intended as a catch-all for algorithmic updates.
    * Also fix a bug when substituting Gaia EDR3 values into the sweeps.
        * ``REF_EPOCH`` wasn't being written.
* Update desitarget.skybricks to support skybricks/v3 [`PR #730`_].
    * The v3 format uses fits.fz files instead of .fits.gz.

0.57.1 (2021-04-07)
-------------------

* Late-breaking updates to MTL for SV3 [`PR #709`_]:
    * Never run the secondary ledgers for ``BACKUP`` targets.
        * Because they *have no* secondary ledgers.
    * Force anything with ``NUMOBS_INIT`` = 9 to ``NUMOBS_INIT`` = 3.
        * As we made a late decision to have 3 passes rather than 9.
        * The first ledger row will reflect 9 to match the target files.
	    * Subsequent rows will change to ``NUMOBS_INIT`` = 3.
	    * And ``NUMOBS_MORE`` will appropriately drop to 2.
* When making a zcat, update ``ZWARN`` using ``DELTACHI2`` [`PR #707`_]:
    * Flag ``ZWARN`` for all targets with ``DELTACHI2 < 25``.
    * Also flag ``BGS`` targets in bright-time with ``DELTACHI2 < 40``.

.. _`PR #707`: https://github.com/desihub/desitarget/pull/707
.. _`PR #709`: https://github.com/desihub/desitarget/pull/709

0.57.0 (2021-04-04)
-------------------

* Updates to MTL schema for SV3 [`PR #706`_]. Includes:
    * Add priorities and initial numbers of observations for SV3.
    * Ensure targets that are both of ELG/QSO revert to QSO if z > 1.6.
    * Turn off the "unlimited BGS observations" Main Survey code for SV3.
    * Add the ``ZWARN`` bitmask to the desitarget bitmask yaml file.
    * Fix a bug where SV2 secondaries didn't have a ``flavor`` property.
        * ``flavor`` in this context is, e.g., ``SPARE``, ``DEDICATED``.
        * Just caught this now as we didn't have secondaries for SV2.
    * Don't process observations if ``ZWARN`` includes ``NODATA``.
        * Such observations are now completely ignored in the MTL loop.
    * Create a system to decrement priorities for ``MORE_ZWARN`` sources.
        * The decrement amount can be controlled by a bit-property.
        * This property is called ``ZWARN_DECREMENT``.
* Updates to BGS for SV3 [`PR #705`_].
    * Updating the BGS bright limit to r > 12 & rfibertotmag > 15.
    * Slightly different faint limits for BASS/MzLS and DECaLS.
        * For both r and rfibermag.
* Bright limit (GAIA_G > 15) AND (ZFIBERTOT > 15) for MWS [`PR #704`_].
    * Applied to all MWS targets (``BROAD/NEARBY/WD/BHB``).
* Further updates to the LRG selection for SV3 [`PR #703`_]. Includes:
    * Change bright-end cut to ``zfibertot`` > 17.5 (instead of > 16).
    * Add low-density (600-per-sq.-deg.) LRG sample (``LRG_LOWDENS``).
        * Bit is informational as ``LRG_LOWDENS`` is a subset of ``LRG``.
    * Update the intersphinx URLs to fix the online documentation builds.

0.56.0 (2021-03-31)
-------------------

* Update the MTL loop to work for secondary ledgers for sv3 [`PR #702`_]:
    * Add tile file to check secondary processing tracks with primaries.
        * called ``scnd-mtl-done-tiles.ecsv``.
    * Default to running secondary ledgers whenever primaries are run.
        * i.e. specifically in the ``run_mtl_loop`` script.
    * Catch some special cases for secondaries.
        * e.g. secondary QSOs should update like primary QSOs.
    * Set ``NUMOBS`` to more sensible numbers for secondary targets.
        * let ``NUMOBS_MORE`` drop to zero and ``PRIORITY`` to ``DONE``.
* Revert ``ELG_LOP`` back to being its own target class [`PR #701`_].
    * But maintain the correct behavior for ``ELG_HIP`` when making MTLs.
* Some bug fixes for SV3 [`PR #700`_]. Includes:
    * Turn on the ``BGS_WISE`` bit, which had been deprecated.
    * Correct behavior for ``ELG_HIP`` when making MTLs.
        * Also change ``ELG_LOP`` to just ``ELG`` for simplicity.
* Update the LRG selection for SV3 (The 1% Survey) [`PR #699`_]:
    * Replace zfiber>16 with zfibertot>16 to reject bright star shreds.

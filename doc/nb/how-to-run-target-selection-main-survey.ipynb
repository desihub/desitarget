    "\n",
    "You will also need to download a copy of the full [DR9 Legacy Surveys directory tree](https://portal.nersc.gov/cfs/cosmo/data/legacysurvey/dr9/) and point the environment variable `$LS_DIR` to the root `dr9` directory. The directory already exists at NERSC at:\n",

    "\n",
    "From this point forward, we will be running production-level code. If you are at NERSC, you may want to familiarize yourself with how to run batch jobs. A straightforward way to run the code is to request interactive nodes. For example, to reserve one interactive Cori Haswell node for 2 hours and 5 minutes at NERSC:\n",

The choice of `nside=8` corresponds to about 50 square degrees, which is reasonably efficient while also producing ouput files of a manageable size. The choice of `--numproc 4` is a decent balance between efficiency and memory use on NERSC compute nodes.\n",

    "## Sky targets ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Production-level runs of blank sky locations are most easily conducted using information generated by the `bundlebricks` command-line option, as also discussed above for random catalogs and under **parallelizing the target selection code**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "select_skies $LS_DIR/south/ $CSCRATCH -s2 $LS_DIR/north/ --bundlebricks 1 --nside 8 --nskiespersqdeg 18000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As with other \"bundling\" commands, this will generate output comprising a script that can be used to parallelize the production of sky files and, as the first part of the output, some useful information outlining how long the script will take to run on NERSC resources. A full production run of sky files at NERSC typically takes about 1-2 hours to run on ~45 Cori nodes with 32 processes per node. The `--nskiespersqdeg 18000` flag specifies that 18000 sky locations should be generated per sq. deg. — this was the value used to process sky locations for the DESI Main Survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to the target files (see also Section 5 of [Myers et al 2022][Myersurl]), it is possible to force the output sky locations to have identical values of `SUBPRIORITY` to those used for the Main Survey production run. This is achieved by adding the `--sky-subpriorities` flag, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "select_skies $LS_DIR/south/ $CSCRATCH -s2 $LS_DIR/north/ --bundlebricks 1 --nside 8 --nskiespersqdeg 18000 --sky-subpriorities $TARG_DIR/subpriority/fba-version-4.0.0/subpriorities-sky.fits\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because sky locations are generated in Legacy Surveys bricks, it is necessary to recast them in HEALPixels (see, also, Section 4.4.1 of [Myers et al 2022][Myersurl]). This can be achieved using the single command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "repartition_skies $CSCRATCH/dr9/1.1.1/skies\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `$CSCRATCH/dr9/1.1.1/skies` is the location to which `select_skies` should have written the HEALPixel-split sky files. Repartitioning skies is very fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to standard, pixel-level sky locations, a full production run of skies includes supplemental sky locations generated by avoiding bright stars from Gaia (see Section 4.4.2 of [Myers et al 2022][Myersurl]). These supplemental files can be processed via a \"bundle\" script generated using a similar command to that used for pixel-level sky locations:\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to `supplement_skies` requiring a different input directory to `select_skies` — because the input is the pixel-level sky locations themselves rather than files from the Legacy Surveys — it is important to note that the bundling option for `supplement_skies` is called `--bundlefiles` rather than `--bundlebricks` — because the parallelization is, indeed, conducted across HEALPixels represented in *files* rather than across Legacy Surveys *bricks*. At NERSC, creating supplemental sky locations takes about an hour using 4 Cori production nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GFA targets ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Targets for guiding, focusing and alignment (GFA targets) are produced using the `select_gfas` command-line option. The overall process is similar to that for `select_targets`, with a `bundlefiles` option being used to produce a parallelizable script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "select_gfas $LS_DIR/south/sweep/9.0 $CSCRATCH -s2 $LS_DIR/north/sweep/9.0 --bundlefiles 1 --nside 8 --numproc 8 --gaiadr edr3\n",
    "```  \n",
    "Here, the `--gaiadr edr3` option specifies that GFAs should be selected using Gaia EDR3. The default if this flag is omitted is to use Gaia DR2. As for `select_targets`, the output from `select_gfas` when the \"bundle\" option is specified includes information about how to run GFA targets on NERSC resources and a script for parellizing the production of files. If you have followed the suggested schema in this notebook of using version `1.1.1` of the `desitarget` code to reproduce DESI Main Survey selection for bright-time and dark-time targets, then the GFA files will be written to `$CSCRATCH/dr9/1.1.1/gfas`\n",
    "At NERSC, a full set of GFA target files takes about an hour to produce when parallelized across 16 Cori nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Secondary targets ##\n",
    "\n",
    "If a secondary directory (`$SCND_DIR`) was passed when processing primary targets (see the `select_targets` command in the **basic production of target files at the command line** section), then secondary targets will have been written to `$SCND_DIR` and matches between secondary and primary targets will have been written to `$SCND_DIR/outdata/1.1.1/priminfo-dr9-1.1.1/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monolithic files of \"standalone\" secondary targets (see Section 4.6.1 of [Myers et al 2022][Myersurl]) can then be (rapidly) produced with the following command:\n",

    "The resulting output files will be written to `$CSCRATCH/dr9/1.1.1/targets/main/secondary/` with one subdirectory for dark-time targets and one for bright-time targets. As with other target classes, it is possible to force each target to have the same value of `SUBPRIORITY` as was used for the Main Survey by adding flags that point to subpriority files, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "select_secondary $SCND_DIR/outdata/1.1.1/priminfo-dr9-1.1.1/ $CSCRATCH --scnddir $SCND_DIR --dark-subpriorities $TARG_DIR/subpriority/fba-version-4.0.0/subpriorities-dark.fits --bright-subpriorities $TARG_DIR/subpriority/fba-version-4.0.0/subpriorities-bright.fits\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## MTL ledgers ##\n",
    "\n",
    "As detailed in [Schlafly et al. (2022)][Schlaflyurl], DESI observations are actually scheduled using MTL (\"Merged Target List\") ledgers rather than the larger target files described above. These ledgers are updated as the DESI survey progresses to reflect the observational state of each target. Assuming that any output target files have been stored in `$CSCRATCH`, then the following commands can be issued to recreate the initial ledgers used for the DESI Main Survey:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "make_initial_mtl_ledger $CSCRATCH/dr9/1.1.1/targets/main/resolve/dark --dest $CSCRATCH --obscon DARK --timestamp 2021-05-13T08:15:37+00:00 --numproc 8\n",
    "make_initial_mtl_ledger $CSCRATCH/dr9/1.1.1/targets/main/resolve/bright --dest $CSCRATCH --obscon BRIGHT --timestamp 2021-05-13T08:15:37+00:00 --numproc 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `--timestamp` indicates an initial UTC/ISO time to be written as the `TIMESTAMP` column for each target in the ledger. The specified value of `2021-05-13T08:15:37+00:00` corresponds to the actual timestamp used for the Main Survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "If secondary target files have been produced, then ledgers of secondary targets can additionally be generated using the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "make_initial_mtl_ledger $CSCRATCH/dr9/1.1.1/targets/main/secondary/dark/targets-dark-secondary.fits --dest $CSCRATCH --obscon DARK --timestamp 2021-05-13T08:15:37+00:00 --numproc 8\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a similar approach can be used to create ledgers of backup targets. As a reminder, this will require switching to the version of the `desitarget` codebase used to process backup targets (`2.2.0` rather than `1.1.1`). Once this switch has been made, the relevant command is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "make_initial_mtl_ledger $CSCRATCH/gaiadr2/2.2.0/targets/main/resolve/backup/ --dest $CSCRATCH --obscon BACKUP --numproc 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ledgers that result from running each of the five `make_initial_mtl_ledger` commands in this section will be generated in the `$CSCRATCH/main/dark`, `$CSCRATCH/main/bright`, `$CSCRATCH/main/secondary/dark`, `$CSCRATCH/main/secondary/bright` and `$CSCRATCH/main/backup` directories. This directory structure reflects the  data model for the MTL ledgers described in [Schlafly et al. (2022)][Schlaflyurl].\n",
    "\n",
    "At NERSC, using the specified 8 processors per node (`--numproc 8`) each of the `make_initial_mtl_ledger` commands takes about 30-40 minutes to run on a single Cori production node."
